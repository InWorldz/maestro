Building maestro is straightforward.

- Install a python compiler.  32 or 64bit should work.  Testing was done with 2.7 so I havent verified Python3 will work.

- Install the dependencies in dependencies.txt

- Run setup.py.  It will generate a set of executables.

- Install NSISETUP.  cd to the PKG directory and run it on the NSI file there to generate the installer.

Thats all there is to it.
